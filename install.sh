To interact with Proton:
1. Start the Proton server(data store in current folder ./proton-data/ ):
   ./$TARGET_FILE server start

2. In a separate terminal, connect to the server:
   ./$TARGET_FILE client
   (Note: If you encounter a 'connection refused' error, use: ./$TARGET_FILE client --host 127.0.0.1)

3. To terminate the server, press ctrl+c in the server terminal.
