# Demo to visualize the sensor data from your phone

[Sensor Logger](https://github.com/tszheichoi/awesome-sensor-logger) is a free, easy-to-use, cross-platform data logger that logs readings from common motion-related sensors on smartphones. Recordings can be exported as a zipped CSV file, or streamed to Proton via HTTP API.

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: start docker compose
Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and fork this repo or download the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to a local folder. Start everything via `docker compose up`. The following containers will be started:
* latest version of Proton, to receive the live data and apply stream processing
* latest version of Grafana, to visualize the live data with streaming SQL
* a lightweight proxy server to convert JSON from sensor loggers to the format for Proton Ingest API

Wait for about half a minute to have all containers up running.

### Step 2: install mobile app and push data to Proton
Download Sensor Logger at www.tszheichoi.com/sensorlogger.

Open the app, and go to the settings page, by clicking the button at the bottom. 
1. Click the `Data Streaming` menu.
2. Turn on `Enable HTTP Push`.
3. Get your IP for your server (on Mac, you can hold Option key and click the WiFi icon to get the IP address), and set the `Push URL` as `http://<ip>:8000`
4. Optionally, you can turn on `Skip Writing`.

### Step 3: view the live dashboard in Grafana

In your laptop/server, access `http://localhost:3000` and open the `Phone Sensor`
