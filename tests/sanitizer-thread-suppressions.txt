# Sanitizer Suppressions File For Proton
# This file contains suppressions for known race conditions in the codebase.

# Known issue: The TimerService is not thread-safe. Future implementations will address this.
# Suppressing race conditions in various TimerService methods.
race:TimerService::startup
race:TimerService::shutdown
race:TimerService::runAt
race:TimerService::runAfter
race:TimerService::runEvery
race:TimerService::cancel

# Known tolerance: The `bool inmemory` in nlog::Log::fetch is not thread-safe.
# This is a deliberate design choice as per the discussion in the following GitHub issue:
# Issue Link: https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton/issues/320#issuecomment-1842414990
race:nlog::Log::fetch

# Potential false positive: GlobalAggregatingTransform::prepareFinalization originally holds a mutex.
# This might be a false positive as the external context ensures thread safety.
